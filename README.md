# 👋 Hey, I'm WixryDev

### 🚀 About me
- 👦 I am a 16 year old full stack developer who knows quite some different programming languages ​​and codes for different occasions but mainly for my own pleasure.

- 📜 In the past I have worked on various projects such as FiveM/RedM servers, and did some minecraft development back in the days but nowadays I mainly make websites and phone apps.

  - 🥇 There are plenty of projects that I've been proud of, but I'm now working on a project called Solvix where I sell FiveM/RedM scripts for a monthly fee, it's one of my so far best successful projects yet.

- 👨‍🎓 Languages I would love to learn are c#, and swift!

  - 🧠 I'm interested in c# because I want to go into game development and start making games from null.

  - 👥 And swift also enable my apps for ios now my apps are mainly for android.

# ⚖️ Here are the languages I conquer

### 1. [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) 2. [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) 3. [Html](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_make_a_website.asp) & [Css]() 4. [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/).

# Old project logs

- below you see several old projects of mine that I give my opinion on

  ### Nova FiveM
  - Nova was a project where we worked with a team of 4 developers, in terms of development nova was a very good learning process but it never got aired because we stopped due to all of our busy schedules
