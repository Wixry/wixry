# 👋 Hey, I'm WixryDev

### 🚀 About me
- 👦 I am a 16-year-old full stack developer who knows quite some different programming languages ​​and codes for different occasions but mainly for my pleasure.

- 📜 In the past I have worked on various projects such as FiveM/RedM servers and did some Minecraft development back in the day but nowadays I mainly make websites and phone apps.

  - 🥇 There are plenty of projects that I've been proud of, but I'm now working on a project called Solvix where I sell FiveM/RedM scripts for a monthly fee, it's one of my so far best successful projects yet.

- 👨‍🎓 Languages I would love to learn are c#, and swift!

  - 🧠 I'm interested in c# because I want to go into game development and start making games from null.

  - 👥 Swift also enables my apps for ios now my apps are mainly for android.

# ⚖️ Languages I conquer

### 1. [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) 2. [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) 3. [Html](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_make_a_website.asp) & [Css]() 4. [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/).

# 🗃️ My current projects

  ### 🚙 Kart logs
  
  - Kart logs is a phone app linked to a website where you can save the data/setup of your karts and thus better analyze it. The app will first be realized for Andriod to test whether it is going to be used, and then after the tests, it will also be available for iOS
  
  ### 📁 Solvix Scripts
  - Solvix scripts is a monthly payment for custom scripts for the platform FiveM, standalone, QBCore and esx.

# 📕 Old project logs

- below you see several old projects of mine that I give my opinion on

  ### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Nova FiveM 2022 - 2023
  
  - Nova was a project where we worked with a team of 4 developers, in terms of development nova was a very good learning process but it never got aired because we stopped due to all of our busy schedules

  ### 🏹 PracticeZone 2021 - 2022
  
  - PracticeZone was a custom-made Minecraft server where you could practice different kinds of minigames

  ### 🔧 Several Roblox games 2018 - 2020
  
  - My first encounter with Lua was with Roblox, did this for quite a while but eventually found it too childish.

- There are many more projects I've worked on, but these are a few of my favourites.
