# Hey, I'm WixryDev 👋

### About me
- 👦 I am a 16 year old full stack developer who knows quite some different programming languages ​​and codes for different occasions but mainly for my own pleasure.

- 📜 In the past I have worked on various projects such as FiveM/RedM servers, and did some minecraft development back in the days but nowadays I mainly make websites and phone apps.

  - There are plenty of projects that I've been proud of, but I'm now working on a project called Solvix where I sell scripts for a monthly fee, it's one of my best    successful projects so far.

- 👨‍🎓 Languages I would love to learn are c#, and swift and learn blender more so my models could be even better!

# Here are the languages I conquer :book:

### 1. [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) 2. [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) 3. [Html](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_make_a_website.asp) & [Css]() 4. [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/).
